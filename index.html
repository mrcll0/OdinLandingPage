        <p>Bitcoin, created in 2009 by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, operates on a decentralized blockchain ledger, recording transactions worldwide.

            Not controlled by any central authority, Bitcoin appeals to those seeking financial freedom and protection from inflation.
            
            With a capped supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin is often dubbed "digital gold" and is viewed as a hedge against economic instability.
            
            Bitcoin's blockchain technology finds applications beyond finance, while its volatility and regulatory scrutiny continue to spark debates.
            
            Despite challenges and price fluctuations, Bitcoin's global impact as a financial innovation remains undeniable.
